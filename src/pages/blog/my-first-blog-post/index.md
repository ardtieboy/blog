Ok, this is quite exciting to me; my first (ever) blogpost. 

A while back I decided it was time to step up my game and express my thoughts, feelings and new discoveries in a blog. The best part of it? All of this is a blog I'm developing and mainting myself. After two years of development experience I feel quite confident enough to try something out like this; so here I am!

In the [WhoAmI](/whoami/) part of my blog, you can discover a bit more about me. In these blog series, I will try to weekly post something new about tech, games or some event in my life. As I'm a developer, changes are rather big that in this process the blog itself will change as well. If you like my blog, would like to discuss something or just want to drink a coffee, feel free to reach out!

Until then, I hope you enjoy browsing around here!
